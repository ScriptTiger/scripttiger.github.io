# Hosts Packages
Hosts packages for Steven Black's hosts repo: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

These hosts packages are updated regularly with Steven Black's hosts files and are for the purposes of older legacy hosts file managing software which require hosted archives to pull from as sources. The directory structure and naming standards are identical to that of Steven Black's repo to ensure the widest range of compatibility across projects. The hosts files in this repo have also been normalized to CRLF to make them more user-friendly for Windows users, while also being just as compatible for any other system, such as Linux, etc.

If you decide to clone this repo for whatever reason, be aware this repo is routinely cleaned of its history to better manage GitHub resources.
