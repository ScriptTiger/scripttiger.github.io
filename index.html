                        Statement:</span> </h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScriptTiger strives to make computers a
                    more
                    work-friendly technology for hard-working people.
                    With data growing more and more abundant, smaller budget
                    organizations
                    or individuals must find a way to traverse all of their data
                    without
                    having to spend exorbitant prices for custom software to
                    generate
                    reports or just find the information they need when they
                    need it
                    without having an IT professional or data scientist at their
                    disposal
                    or having to spend days, weeks, or months copying and
                    pasting data from
                    one form to another. ScriptTiger's goal is to empower
                    individuals in
                    the workplace to get
                    the data they need in the way they need it by having only
                    the fewest
                    prerequisites possible to ensure that no matter where they
                    move to in
                    their organization, what software may or may not be
                    approved, or what
                    degree of techncal know-how they can
                    still do their job in the most efficient way possible. With
                    workplace
                    environments and simplicity in mind, ScriptTiger focuses on
                    Windows
                    command line and batch file scripting, but does touch on
                    linking to
                    individual third-party utilities (primarily things like
                    using cURL or
                    Wget for HTTP/HTTPS and
                    PuTTY for Telnet/SSH), Cygwin, and PowerShell in certain
                    situations
                    to access data sources or other functionality otherwise not
                    available
                    while keeping the core of the execution logic contained
                    within the
                    basic Windows command processor environment.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most scripters have come to rely
                    on languages
                    like Python across
                    operating systems, it doesn't come standard on Windows and
                    may not be
                    authorized in certain work environments. The goal of
                    ScriptTiger is to
                    empower you with the knowledge of the standard Windows
                    command
                    processor and how to use it to make true native Windows
                    scripts instead
                    of bringing over other languages to do its job without
                    sacrificing the
                    functionality you need to get the job done. The inherent
                    simplicity of
                    the Windows command line makes it easier to learn than other
                    languages,
                    but also lends itslef to the misconception that this
                    simplicity limits
                    its abilities in some way. To the contrary, after truly
                    taking the time
                    to understand the fundamentals, you will soon realize that
                    the
                    simplicity offers you the ability to think about what needs
                    to be done
                    in more bite-sized pieces and allows these pieces to work
                    together in
                    more complex functions. If you are new to scripting, or just
                    programming in general, remembering to take things slow and
                    thinking
                    about the steps needed to accomplish something should always
                    be top of
                    mind, as it's easy to get overwhelmed by the thought of a
                    complex task
                    that seemingly has no clear solution.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although ScriptTiger covers many topics
                    with the
                    intent to educate,
                    ScriptTiger also produces many ready-to-use example scripts
                    and lookup
                    tables that may also be useful for those wanting to
                    accomplish the task
                    but not necessarily learn how it's done. While most of the
                    ScriptTiger
                    scripts relate to networking, there may be other sripts
                    which relate to
                    other topics of interest arising from community feeback,
                    such as
                    scripts for gaming and even some Excel VBScript for extended
                    data
                    mining and reporting.</td>
