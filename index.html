<h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScriptTiger strives to make computers a more
work-friendly technology for hard-working people.
With data growing more and more abundant, smaller budget organizations
or individuals must find a way to traverse all of their data without
having to spend exorbitant prices for custom software to generate
reports or just find the information they need when they need it
without having an IT professional or data scientist at their disposal
or having to spend days, weeks, or months copying and pasting data from
one form to another. ScriptTiger's goal is to empower individuals in
the workplace to get
the data they need in the way they need it by having only the fewest
prerequisites possible to ensure that no matter where they move to in
their organization, what software may or may not be approved, or what
degree of techncal know-how they can
still do their job in the most efficient way possible. With workplace
environments and simplicity in mind, ScriptTiger focuses on Windows
command line and batch file scripting, but does touch on linking to
individual third-party utilities (primarily cURL for HTTP/HTTPS and
PuTTY for Telnet/SSH), Cygwin, and PowerShell in certain situations
to access data sources or other functionality otherwise not available
while keeping the core of the execution logic contained within the
basic Windows command processor environment.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While ScriptTiger covers many topics with the intent to educate,
ScriptTiger also produces many ready-to-use example scripts and lookup
tables that may also be useful for those wanting to accomplish the task
but not necessarily learn how it's done. While most of the ScriptTiger
scripts relate to networking, there may be other sripts which relate to
other topics of interest arising from community feeback, such as
scripts for gaming and even some Excel VBScript for extended data
mining and reporting.<br>
