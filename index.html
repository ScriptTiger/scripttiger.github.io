<h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ScriptTiger strives to make computers a more
work-friendly technology for hard-working people.
With data growing more and more abundant, smaller budget organizations
or individuals must find a way to traverse all of their data without
having to spend exorbitant prices for custom software to generate
reports or just find the information they need when they need it
without having an IT professional or data scientist at their disposal
or having to spend days, weeks, or months copying and pasting data from
one form to another. ScriptTiger's goal is to empower individuals in
the workplace to get
the data they need in the way they need it by having only the fewest
prerequisites possible to ensure that no matter where they move to in
their organization, what software may or may not be approved, or what
degree of techncal know-how they can
still do their job in the most efficient way possible. With workplace
environments and simplicity in mind, ScriptTiger focuses on Windows
command line and batch file scripting, but does touch on linking to
individual third-party utilities (primarily things like using cURL or
Wget for HTTP/HTTPS and
PuTTY for Telnet/SSH), Cygwin, and PowerShell in certain situations
to access data sources or other functionality otherwise not available
while keeping the core of the execution logic contained within the
basic Windows command processor environment.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most scripters have come to rely on languages
like Python across
operating systems, it doesn't come standard on Windows and may not be
authorized in certain work environments. The goal of ScriptTiger is to
empower you with the knowledge of the standard Windows command
processor and how to use it to make true native Windows scripts instead
of bringing over other languages to do its job without sacrificing the
functionality you need to get the job done. The inherent simplicity of
the Windows command line makes it easier to learn than other languages,
but also lends itslef to the misconception that this simplicity limits
its abilities in some way. To the contrary, after truly taking the time
to understand the fundamentals, you will soon realize that the
simplicity offers you the ability to think about what needs to be done
in more bite-sized pieces and allows these pieces to work together in
more complex functions. If you are new to scripting, or just
programming in general, remembering to take things slow and thinking
about the steps needed to accomplish something should always be top of
mind, as it's easy to get overwhelmed by the thought of a complex task
that seemingly has no clear solution.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although ScriptTiger covers many topics with the
intent to educate,
ScriptTiger also produces many ready-to-use example scripts and lookup
tables that may also be useful for those wanting to accomplish the task
but not necessarily learn how it's done. While most of the ScriptTiger
scripts relate to networking, there may be other sripts which relate to
other topics of interest arising from community feeback, such as
scripts for gaming and even some Excel VBScript for extended data
mining and reporting.</td>
