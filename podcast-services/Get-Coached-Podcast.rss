			<title><![CDATA[How To Unlock The Power Of Mastermind Groups]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Aaron Walker has founded more than a dozen companies over the past 41 years. He attributes much of his success to having surrounded himself with his mastermind counterparts. Aaron spent a decade meeting weekly with Dave Ramsey, Dan Miller, Ken Abraham, and 5 other amazing entrepreneurs. Aaron is the founder of Iron Sharpens Iron Mastermind that now hosts 15 groups with National and International members. Aaron is the author of View From The Top, a must-read to fully understand how to live a life of success and significance. Also, the founder of The Mastermind Playbook an incredible resource for starting, running and scaling masterminds. Aaron lives in Nashville Tennessee with his wife Robin of 40 years and he has 2 incredible daughters and 5 beautiful grandchildren.</p>
<p>In Iron Sharpens Iron Mastermind, we are fortunate to have members from eight different countries participating in 15 mastermind groups that meet weekly on a video platform. I have received so many personal requests from entrepreneurs to teach them how to build their own successful mastermind groups. Because of that, I created “The Mastermind Playbook” which is honestly a business in a box. The 30 videos and 100 plus tools, systems and processes included will walk you step by step on how to start, run and scale mastermind groups. This is not a concept, we are social proof that this system works incredibly well. I have been personally involved in a mastermind weekly for two decades now, and it has radically changed my life.</p>
