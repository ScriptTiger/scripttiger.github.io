Podcast Services
</h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running a casual podcast and don't want to pay
"professional" rates for professional services, such as audio editing
and fine-tuning, ID3 tagging, transcriptions, and more? Or perhaps you
are running a professional podcast and you're just tired of paying
hundreds of dollars a month for someone to just throw all your podcasts
into a batch with all of their other clients and process them all
together with the same algorithms without ever actually listening to
anything? As any marketer will tell you, having to pay a high price
doesn't guarantee high quality of service. In fact, most products and
services take advantage of this misconception and charge you as high as
they can when they know they can get away with it and promote the price
as matching the service. But does the price really match the service?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ScriptTiger isn't a veteran of the industry, he still works there and
has a day job. However, in his free time he likes to keep busy with
things he feels passionately about, such as helping podcasters get that
look and feel they want at a shameless price point they don't feel they
need to be proud about. So if you're one of those podcasters putting
hundreds or even thousands of dollars into your gear and "professional"
services thinking it will help you be successful and spend little
to&nbsp;no time "worrying" about the content, ScriptTiger's services
are NOT right for you. ScriptTiger already has a day job in
"professional" services and feels passionately about giving back in his
free time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right now ScriptTiger's podcast
services are under a trial period, so taking on new clients and
assigning services and handling billing will be conducted on a
case-by-case basis. Some services offered are audio editing and
fine-tuning done by a human with pride that actually listens when you
say, "Cut that last part out;" ID3 tagging, including album art
(provided by you, ScriptTiger is not a graphic designer); manual
transcriptions generated by a human with an extremely high accuracy
guaranteed that dramatically improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
as well as enable the hearing impaired to also enjoy your podcast;
custom RSS hosted by ScriptTiger to finally unlock&nbsp;features like
all three search categories and subcategories instead of just being
stuck with one because your host has arbitrary limitations (you will
still need your current host to store your audio files, ScripTiger is
not offering unlimited storage and bandwidth); and more, as made
available during your initial free consultation.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feeling anxious and put-off because&nbsp;we haven't talked about prices
yet? Well, no prices are fixed and everything is negotiable. So what
CAN be guaranteed? If you're audio quality is good and your content is
something ScriptTiger can be proud about supporting, you could be
paying as little as $0.50 to $1 per audio minute, which includes
everything. Obviously when you do the math and compare that to what
other professional service providers charge, like forcing you to get
locked into monthly subscriptions that charge you hundreds of dollars
when you only put out a couple episodes a month, it may seem like
things just simply don't add up. It may also seem curious how some
services charge fixed flat rates for every customer and every episode,
but it starts to make sense when you think about how all they do is
send everything through the same generic automated process without
listening to anything or verifying quality. But how could the price
literally be a fraction of the cost of what everyone else is charging
and still be of as high a quality as claimed? Well, ScriptTiger has
been in the industry a while and can do most of the common tasks just
in the amount of time it takes to listen to a podcast episode once. The
key here being ScriptTiger actually listens to every podcast episode
and doesn't produce anything he can't get behind. ScriptTiger will only
spend as much time on your episodes as you pay him for, so he won't
just send your file through automation nor will he be taking night
classes to learn a new language to transcribe anything that isn't in
English. If you want to pay someone exorbitant hourly rates for only
spending a few minutes, if any time at all, on your work, again,
ScriptTiger is NOT right for you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you've
made it to the last paragraph, still interested, and want to know where
to start? Contact ScriptTiger now and ask about getting your first free
episode!</td>
